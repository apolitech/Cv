WORK EXPERIENCE

08/2017–Present
QA Engineer
Ubuntu Mate (project)
Ubuntu MATE is a stable, easy-to-use Linux operating system with a configurable desktop
environment base on Ubuntu.
As a QA team member i have the responsibility to test the OS and the Core applications in the
different stages of the life cycle, to have a close relationship with the devs and triaje the issues raised
by the users.
We are using Slack as the internal messaging app, Github and Launchpad for keeping track of the
patches, issues etc.
Here is my launchpad account
Here is the official QA team of Ubuntu Mate
*Launchpad, developed by Canonical, is a system used to keep track of many aspects of open-
source development. Launchpad's features include code hosting, bug tracking, translation, feature
blueprints and a community-based answer tracker.


2013–Present
QA Engineer
Project
I've started reporting issus that i had with a Ubuntu or a flavor of it. From the core aplications , desktop
environments, open source aplications to the kernel (drivers).
In 2005 i've find a new Ubuntu distribution named Ubuntu Mate and started to use all my time testing
it. In the summer of 2017 they move the DE (desktop environments) from gtk2 to gtk3 and i've posted
over 100 issues (over 85% of the total issues raised on launchpad) in just 3 months.
*GTK+, or the GIMP Toolkit, is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces. Offering a
complete set of widgets, GTK+ is suitable for projects ranging from small one-off tools to complete
application suites.

versions based on Ubuntu that help developers in reproducing problems and repairing them.
After one year on the platform, users started to ask and requests a site. So i've made one.
On the site i had all sorts of tutorials ("How to", "Gaming", "Tweaks",etc.) in English for distributions
based on Ubuntu.

stage to the stable release and for every architecture 32 bit, 64 bit or ARM.
▪ Here is one made by me that i fallow for testing applications. Is more a general schematic because
some times there can be a interface package missing or conflict with one or more packages
(themes, ppa not yet updated for the new OS version, etc) when installing from a .deb or a ppa and
test cases can be more or less easy to put on paper.
Aplications
I've made 3 electron web aplications that are in the snap* format:
▪ Ubuntu Mate Launchpad (GitHub)
▪ Udemy (GitHub)
▪ SoloLearn (GitHub)
*****
A snap :
▪ is a squashFS filesystem containing your app code and a snap.yaml file containing specific
metadata. It has a read-only file-system and, once installed, a writable area.
▪ is self-contained. It bundles most of the libraries and runtimes it needs and can be updated and
reverted without affecting the rest of the system.
▪ is confined from the OS and other apps through security mechanisms, but can exchange content
and functions with other snaps according to fine-grained policies controlled by the user and the OS
defaults.
